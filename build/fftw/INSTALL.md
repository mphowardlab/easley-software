To build FFTW, you need to modify OpenMP linking in the CMake scripts.
Pull a copy of the source code you want to use manually, then change the
linking command from
```
target_link_libraries(${fftw3_lib}_omp ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT})
```
to
```
target_link_libraries(${fftw3_lib}_omp OpenMP::OpenMP_C)
```
and remove the line setting the `target_compile_options`.

**Do not** check-in the FFTW source code. Most of this is autogenerated stuff,
and it will make this software repo get huge.
